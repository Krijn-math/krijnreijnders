            <p>This is my website, which serves to host some of my (professional)
                writings, some thoughts that I have at times and an online version of my
                cv. </p>

            <h2>post-quantum cryptography</h2>
            <p>My research focuses on <b>post-quantum cryptography</b>,
                specifically code-based and
                isogeny-based schemes. Essentially, I look at <b>isogenies</b> and
                <b>isometries</b>. </p>

            <p>
                Within isogenies, my more specific research interests are (applications
                of) <b>pairings</b> and <b>Kummer surfaces</b>. Within isometries, I focus on the
                interplay between automorphism groups and <b>matrix code equivalence</b>.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>the isogeny club</h2>
            <p>For the first two years, I organized <a href="https://isogeny.club" target="_blank">The Isogeny Club</a>,
                together with <b>Jonathan Komada Eriksen</b> (<a href="https://jonathke.github.io/" target="_blank">www</a>).
                Since, May 2024, I have stepped back and taken a more advisory role,
                with <b>Maria Corte-Real Santos</b> (<a href="https://www.mariascrs.com/" target="_blank">www</a>) taking over as co-host of the bi-weekly
                virtual seminar for young isogenists. The Isogeny Club also hosts the
                <a href="https://isogeny.club/eurocrypt" target="_blank">Brainstorm Days</a>
                as an affiliated event (for all isogenists) at
                Eurocrypt, where we brainstorm on cutting-edge ideas in isogeny-based
                cryptography.</p>
