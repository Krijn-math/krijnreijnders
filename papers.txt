dctidh: fast & deterministic ctidh;fabio campos, andreas hellenbrand, michael meyer, krĳn reĳnders;2025/107;<p>This paper presents dCTIDH, a CSIDH implementation that combines two recent developments into a novel state-of-the-art deterministic implementation. We combine the approach of deterministic variants of CSIDH with the batching strategy of CTIDH, which shows that the full potential of this key space has not yet been explored. This high-level adjustment in itself leads to a significant speed-up. To achieve an effective deterministic evaluation in constant time, we introduce Wombats, a new approach to performing isogenies in batches, specifically tailored to the behavior required for deterministic CSIDH using CTIDH batching. </p><p></p><p>Furthermore, we explore the two-dimensional space of optimal primes for dCTIDH, with regard to both the performance of dCTIDH in terms of finite-field operations per prime and the efficiency of finite-field operations, determined by the prime shape, in terms of cycles. This allows us to optimize both for choice of prime and scheme parameters simultaneously. Lastly, we implement and benchmark constant-time, deterministic dCTIDH. Our results show that dCTIDH not only outperforms state-of-the-art deterministic CSIDH, but even non-deterministic CTIDH: dCTIDH-2048 is faster than CTIDH-2048 by 17 percent, and is almost five times faster than dCSIDH-2048.</p>
optimized one-dimensional sqisign verification on intel and cortex-m4;marius a. aardal, gora adj, arwa alblooshi, diego f. aranha, isaac a. canales-martínez, jorge chavez-saab, décio luiz gazzoni filho, krĳn reĳnders, francisco rodríguez-henríquez;2024/1563;<p>SQIsign is a well-known post-quantum signature scheme due to its small combined signature and public-key size. However, SQIsign suffers from notably long signing times, and verification times are not short either. To improve this, recent research has explored both one-dimensional and two-dimensional variants of SQIsign, each with distinct characteristics. In particular, SQIsign2D's efficient signing and verification times have made it a focal point of recent research. However, the absence of an optimized one-dimensional verification implementation hampers a thorough comparison between these different variants.</p><p></p><p>This work bridges this gap in the literature: we provide a state-of-the-art implementation of one-dimensional SQIsign verification, including novel optimizations. We report a record-breaking one-dimensional SQIsign verification time of 8.55 Mcycles on a Raptor Lake Intel processor, closely matching SQIsign2D on the same processor. For uncompressed signatures, the signature size doubles and we verify in only 5.6 Mcycles. Taking advantage of the inherent parallelism available in isogeny computations, we present 5-core variants that can go as low as 1.3 Mcycles. Furthermore, we present the first implementation that supports both 32-bit and 64-bit processors. It includes optimized assembly code for the Cortex-M4 and has been integrated with the pqm4 project. Our results motivate further research into one-dimensional SQIsign, as it boasts unique features among isogeny-based schemes.</p>
return of the kummer: a toolbox for genus-2 cryptography;maria corte-real santos, krĳn reĳnders;2024/948;<p>This work expands the machinery we have for isogeny-based cryptography in genus 2 by developing a toolbox of several essential algorithms for Kummer surfaces, the dimension-2 analogue of $x$-only arithmetic on elliptic curves. Kummer surfaces have been suggested in hyper-elliptic curve cryptography since at least the 1980s and recently these surfaces have reappeared to efficiently compute $(2,2)$-isogenies. We construct several essential analogues of techniques used in one-dimensional isogeny-based cryptography, such as pairings, deterministic point sampling and point compression and give an overview of $(2,2)$-isogenies on Kummer surfaces. We furthermore show how Scholten's construction can be used to transform isogeny-based cryptography over elliptic curves over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ into protocols over Kummer surfaces over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$</p><p></p><p>As an example of this approach, we demonstrate that SQIsign verification can be performed completely on Kummer surfaces, and, therefore, that one-dimensional SQIsign verification can be viewed as a two-dimensional isogeny between products of elliptic curves. Curiously, the isogeny is then defined over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ rather than $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$. Contrary to expectation, the cost of SQIsign verification using Kummer surfaces does not explode: verification costs only 1.5$\times$ more in terms of finite field operations than the SQIsign variant AprèsSQI, optimised for fast verification. Furthermore, it is plausible that arithmetic on Kummer surfaces can be efficiently vectorised, giving Kummer-based protocols over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ a potential performance boost on modern architectures, possibly surpassing the performance of elliptic-curve analogues over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$</p>
aprèssqi: extra fast verification for sqisign using extension-field signing;maria corte-real santos, jonathan komada eriksen, michael meyer, krĳn reĳnders;2023/1559;<p>We optimise the verification of the SQIsign signature scheme. By using field extensions in the signing procedure, we are able to significantly increase the amount of available rational $2$-power torsion in verification, which achieves a significant speed-up. This, moreover, allows several other speed-ups on the level of curve arithmetic. We show that the synergy between these high-level and low-level improvements gives significant improvements, making verification $2.07$ times faster, or up to $3.41$ times when using size-speed trade-offs, compared to the state of the art, without majorly degrading the performance of signing.</p>
effective pairings in isogeny-based cryptography;krĳn reĳnders;2023/858;<p>Pairings are useful tools in isogeny-based cryptography and have been used in SIDH/SIKE and other protocols. As a general technique, pairings can be used to move problems about points on curves to elements in finite fields. However, until now, their applicability was limited to curves over fields with primes of a specific shape and pairings seemed too costly for the type of primes that are nowadays often used in isogeny-based cryptography. We remove this roadblock by optimizing pairings for highly-composite degrees such as those encountered in CSIDH and SQISign. This makes the general technique viable again: We apply our low-cost pairing to problems of general interest, such as supersingularity verification and finding full-torsion points, and show that we can outperform current methods, in some cases up to four times faster than the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we analyze how pairings can be used to improve deterministic and dummy-free CSIDH. Finally, we provide a constant-time implementation (in Rust) that shows the practicality of these algorithms.</p>
optimizations and practicality of high-security csidh;fabio campos, jorge chavez-saab, jesús-javier chi-domínguez, michael meyer, krĳn reĳnders, francisco rodríguez-henríquez, peter schwabe, thom wiggers;2023/793;<p>In this work, we assess the real-world practicality of CSIDH, an isogeny-based non-interactive key exchange. We provide the first thorough assessment of the practicality of CSIDH in higher parameter sizes for conservative estimates of quantum security, and with protection against physical attacks.</p><p></p><p>This requires a three-fold analysis of CSIDH. First, we describe two approaches to efficient high-security CSIDH implementations, based on SQALE and CTIDH. Second, we optimize such high-security implementations, on a high level by improving several subroutines, and on a low level by improving the finite field arithmetic. Third, we benchmark the performance of high-security CSIDH. As a stand-alone primitive, our implementations outperform previous results by a factor up to 2.53×.</p><p></p><p>As a real-world use case considering network protocols, we use CSIDH in TLS variants that allow early authentication through a NIKE. Although our instantiations of CSIDH have smaller communication requirements than post-quantum KEM and signature schemes, even our highly-optimized implementations result in too-large handshake latency (tens of seconds), showing that CSIDH is only practical in niche cases.</p>
a guide to the design of digital signatures based on cryptographic group actions;giacomo borin, edoardo persichetti, paolo santini, federico pintore, krĳn reĳnders;2023/718;<p>Cryptography based on group actions has been studied since 1990. </p><p>In recent years, however, the area has seen a revival, partially due to its role in post-quantum cryptography. For instance, several works have proposed signature schemes based on group actions, as well as a variety of techniques aimed at improving their performance and efficiency. Most of these techniques can be explained as transforming one Sigma protocol into another, while essentially preserving security. In this work, we present a unified taxonomy of such techniques. In particular, we describe all techniques in a single fashion, show how they impact the performance of the resulting protocols and analyse in detail how different techniques can be combined for optimal performance. Furthermore, to provide a tangible perspective, we apply the results of our analysis to the (group action-based) candidates in the current NIST call for digital signatures. This gives a full overview of the state of the art of signatures based on group actions, as well as a flexible tool which is easy to adapt and employ in the design of future schemes.</p>
take your meds: digital signatures from matrix code equivalence;tung chou, ruben niederhagen, edoardo persichetti, tovohery hajatiana randrianarisoa, krĳn reĳnders, simona samardjiska, monika trimoska;2022/1559;<p>In this paper, we show how to use the Matrix Code Equivalence (MCE) problem as a new basis to construct signature schemes. This extends previous work on using isomorphism problems for signature schemes, a trend that has recently emerged in post-quantum cryptography. Our new formulation leverages a more general problem and allows for smaller data sizes, achieving competitive performance and great flexibility. Using MCE, we construct a zero-knowledge protocol which we turn into a signature scheme named Matrix Equivalence Digital Signature (MEDS). We provide an initial choice of parameters for MEDS, tailored to NIST's Category 1 security level, yielding public keys as small as 2.8 kB and signatures ranging from 18 kB to just around 6.5 kB, along with a reference implementation in C.</p>
disorientation faults in csidh;gustavo banegas, juliane krämer, tanja lange, michael meyer, lorenz panny, krĳn reĳnders, jana sotáková, monika trimoska;2022/1202;<p>We investigate a new class of fault-injection attacks against the CSIDH family of cryptographic group actions. Our disorientation attacks effectively flip the direction of some isogeny steps. We achieve this by faulting a specific subroutine, connected to the Legendre symbol or Elligator computations performed during the evaluation of the group action. These subroutines are present in almost all known CSIDH implementations. Post-processing a set of faulty samples allows us to infer constraints on the secret key. The details are implementation specific, but we show that in many cases, it is possible to recover the full secret key with only a modest number of successful fault injections and modest computational resources. We provide full details for attacking the original CSIDH proof-of-concept software as well as the CTIDH constant-time implementation. Finally, we present a set of lightweight countermeasures against the attack and discuss their security.</p>
patient zero and patient six: zero-value and correlation attacks on csidh and sike;fabio campos, michael meyer, krĳn reĳnders, marc stöttinger;2022/904;<p>Recent works have started side-channel analysis on SIKE and show the vulnerability of isogeny-based systems to zero-value attacks. In this work, we expand on such attacks by analyzing the behavior of the zero curve $E_0$ and six curve $E_6$ in CSIDH and SIKE. We demonstrate an attack on static-key CSIDH and SIKE implementations that recovers bits of the secret key by observing via zero-value-based resp. exploiting correlation-collision-based side-channel analysis whether secret isogeny walks pass over the zero or six curve. We apply this attack to fully recover secret keys of SIKE and two state-of-the-art CSIDH-based implementations: CTIDH and SQALE. We show the feasibility of exploiting side-channel information for the proposed attacks based on simulations with various realistic noise levels. Additionally, we discuss countermeasures to prevent zero-value and correlation-collision attacks against CSIDH and SIKE in our attacker model.</p>
hardness estimates of the code equivalence problem in the rank metric;krĳn reĳnders, simona samardjiska, monika trimoska;2022/276;<p>In this paper, we analyze the hardness of the Matrix Code Equivalence (MCE) problem for matrix codes endowed with the rank metric, and provide the first algorithms for solving it. We do this by making a connection to another well-known equivalence problem from multivariate cryptography - the Isomorphism of Polynomials (IP).</p><p>Under mild assumptions, we give tight reductions from MCE to the homogenous version of the Quadratic Maps Linear Equivalence (QMLE) problem, and vice versa. Furthermore, we present reductions to and from similar problems in the sum-rank metric, showing that MCE is at the core of code equivalence problems.</p><p></p><p>On the practical side, using birthday techniques known for IP, we present two algorithms: a probabilistic algorithm for MCE running in time $q^{\frac{2}{3}(n+m)}$ up to a polynomial factor, and a deterministic algorithm for MCE with roots, running in time $q^{\min\{m,n,k\}}$ up to a polynomial factor. Lastly, to confirm these findings, we solve randomly generated instances of MCE using these two algorithms.</p>
fully projective radical isogenies in constant-time;jesús-javier chi-domínguez, krĳn reĳnders;2021/259;<p>At PQCrypto-2020, Castryck and Decru proposed CSURF (CSIDH on the surface) as an improvement to the CSIDH protocol.</p><p>Soon after that, at Asiacrypt-2020, together with Vercauteren they introduced radical isogenies as a further improvement. The main improvement in these works is that both CSURF and radical isogenies require only one torsion point to initiate a chain of isogenies, in comparison to Vélu isogenies which require a torsion point per isogeny. Both works were implemented using non-constant-time techniques, however, in a realistic scenario, a constant-time implementation is necessary to mitigate risks of timing attacks. The analysis of constant-time CSURF and radical isogenies was left as an open problem by Castryck, Decru, and Vercauteren.</p><p>In this work, we analyze this problem. A straightforward constant-time implementation of CSURF and radical isogenies</p><p>encounters too many issues to be cost-effective, but we resolve some of these issues with new optimization techniques. We introduce projective radical isogenies to save costly inversions and present a hybrid strategy for the integration of radical isogenies in CSIDH implementations. These improvements make radical isogenies almost twice as efficient in constant-time, in terms of finite field multiplications. Using these improvements, we then measure the algorithmic performance in a benchmark</p><p>of CSIDH, CSURF and CRADS (an implementation using radical isogenies) for different prime sizes. Our implementation provides a more accurate comparison between CSIDH, CSURF and CRADS than the original benchmarks, by using state-of-the-art techniques for all three implementations. Our experiments illustrate that the speed-up of constant-time CSURF-512 with radical isogenies is reduced to about 3% in comparison to the fastest state-of-the-art constant-time CSIDH-512 implementation. The performance is worse for larger primes, as radical isogenies scale worse than Vélu isogenies.</p>
