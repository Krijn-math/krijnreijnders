            <p>
                Here are some notes that might help out someone someday.
                They are essentially small writings, mostly mathematical, that serve to exemplify
                a topic. They are not meant to be comprehensive, but rather to give a taste.

            <h3>The Cokernel Pairing</h3>
            <p>
                We study a new pairing, beyond the Weil and Tate pairing.
                The Weil pairing is a non-degenerate pairing
                which operates on the kernel of the multiplication-by-m map.
                Similarly, when the m-th roots of unity are rational, the Tate pairing
                is a non-degenerate pairing
                which connects the kernel and the rational cokernel of the multiplication-by-m map.
                We define a pairing which operates directly
                on the rational cokernels of this map, filling the gap left 
                by the Weil and Tate pairing.
                When the m-torsion is rational, this pairing is non-degenerate, and can be 
                computed using three Tate pairings, and two 
                discrete logarithms, given a basis for the m-torsion. 
                When m = ell is a (small) prime, this pairing allows us to study the rational cokernel directly directly
                and simplifies the computation of a basis for the ell-power torsion, and more generally the Sylow ell-torsion. 
                This finds many applications in isogeny-based cryptography when computing prime-power isogenies.

            <h3>Optimized Cubical Pairings of Degree 2 for Subgroup Membership Testing in Genus 2</h3>
            <p>
                In this short paper, we combine two new techniques in pairings to
                do subgroup membership testing for the Gaudry–Schost Kummer surface: 
                showing that a point P is in the subgroup G of large prime order.
                First, we generalize Koshelev’s method for subgroup membership testing
                using Tate pairings to higher dimensions. Second, using Robert’s
                cubical arithmetic, we optimize degree-2 Tate pairings on Kummer surfaces. 
                We verify P is in G using only 6 additions, 10 multiplications, and
                4 Legendre symbols.

            <h3>The Advanced Use of the Tate Pairing</h3>
            <p>
            This short note explains how the Tate pairing can be used to efficiently sample torsion points
            with precise requirements, and other applications. These applications are most clearly explained
            on Montgomery curves, using the Tate pairing of degree 2, but hold more generally for any degree
            or abelian variety, or even generalized Tate pairings. 
            
            This note is explanatory in nature; it does not contain new results, but aims to provide a clear
            and concise explanation of results in the literature that are somewhat hidden, yet are extremely
            useful in practical isogeny-based cryptography.

            <h3>Radical Isogenies on (Twisted) Edwards Curves</h3>
            <p>In this note, we try to find radical isogenies on twisted
            Edwards curves. We will do so by first looking at what radical
            isogenies are, and then look at how radical isogenies should work on
            twisted Edwards curves. Finally, by firing up a computer algebra
            system, we find the concrete radical isogeny formula for degree 3 on
            twisted Edwards curves.

            <h3>Number of Matrices of Given Rank over a Finite Field</h3>
            <p> It has long been known that one can count the number of matrices of given rank
                over a finite field using linear algebra. In this note, we try to give an argument
                based only on combinatorics instead.
